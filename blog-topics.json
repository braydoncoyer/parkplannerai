      "prompt": "Write a capstone analysis showing the universal daily wait time curve that applies to nearly every Orlando theme park. The pattern: low at open, rapid rise for 2-3 hours, peak around 11am-2pm, slight afternoon plateau or dip, secondary peak around 3-5pm, then steady decline into evening. Show this curve for each park and highlight where they differ. Explain the psychology and behavior behind the curve (guests arrive, lunch patterns, heat fatigue, dinner departures). This is the single most important insight for any theme park visitor. End with a strong CTA to use ParkPlannerAI to see real-time where you are on this curve during your visit."
