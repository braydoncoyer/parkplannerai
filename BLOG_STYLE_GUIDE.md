# ParkPlannerAI Blog Style Guide

This is the style guide for all blog articles on ParkPlannerAI. Every article must follow these rules to maintain a consistent voice, structure, and quality bar. Reference this document at the start of every writing session.

## Voice and Tone

### We write for the reader
The reader is planning a theme park trip and wants to have the best day possible. Everything we write should serve that goal. We are on their side.

- Use "you" and "your" freely. This is a conversation with the reader.
- Use "we" when referring to ParkPlannerAI or the data we've collected. "We tracked wait times across all five worlds so you don't have to learn this the hard way."
- Be enthusiastic where it's earned. Exclamation marks are welcome when we're genuinely excited about a finding or giving the reader good news. "Your feet will thank you!" is good. Don't overdo it — one or two per section is plenty.
- Be direct and opinionated. We have data. We've done the work. We should confidently recommend what to do, not hedge with "it depends" or "your mileage may vary."

### We are data-driven, not fluffy
- Lead with specific numbers. "Waits drop by 50% in the last two hours" is better than "waits tend to decrease in the evening."
- Bold key numbers and insights for scannability.
- Every claim should be grounded in data or observable patterns. No hand-waving.

### We are not a robot
- Never start an article with "In this article, we'll explore..." or "Are you planning a trip to...?" or any variation of AI preamble. Start with the insight.
- Never use phrases like "whether you're a first-time visitor or a seasoned veteran" or "in today's fast-paced world" or any generic filler.
- Never use "it's important to note" or "it's worth mentioning." Just say the thing.
- Vary sentence length. Mix short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones. Read it out loud — if it sounds monotone, rewrite it.

## Structure

### Headings target long-tail keywords
Every H2 heading should read like something a real person would search for on Google. Think about what the reader would type.

Good headings:
- "Why Dark Universe Is the Most Underrated Land at Epic Universe"
- "When to Visit Super Nintendo World for the Shortest Waits"
- "The Best Order to Tour Epic Universe's Five Worlds"

Bad headings:
- "Key Findings"
- "Data Analysis"
- "Our Recommendations"
- "Section 3: Results"

### Don't put the summary table at the top
The ranking table or comparison table should come near the bottom of the article, not the top. If readers see the full summary immediately, they leave. Walk them through the analysis world-by-world (or park-by-park, hour-by-hour) first, then give them the summary table as a reward for reading.

### Paragraphs over lists
Most content should be written as paragraphs under specific headings, not as bullet-point lists. Lists are lazy and they don't rank well.

- Maximum of ONE list or table per article.
- If you find yourself reaching for bullets, write it as a paragraph under a keyword-rich heading instead.
- The one allowed list/table should be the data comparison table, placed near the end.

### Article length
Target 800–1200 words. Long enough to be thorough, short enough that nobody bounces.

### Opening paragraph
The first paragraph should do two things:
1. State the core tension or insight (the "why should I care")
2. Tell the reader what they'll get from this article

Do this in 2-3 sentences. No throat-clearing.

Example: "Epic Universe has five worlds, and they are not created equal when it comes to wait times. If you walk in without a plan, you'll probably burn two hours in a single queue while an entire land sits half-empty on the other side of the park."

### Closing
End with a brief, natural mention of ParkPlannerAI's analytics dashboard or Plan My Visit tool. One sentence, maybe two. Do not write a sales pitch. The reader just got a ton of free value — a light nudge is enough.

Example: "You can track these patterns in real time on ParkPlannerAI's analytics dashboard, or let the Plan My Visit tool build a world-by-world itinerary based on current crowd predictions."

## Formatting Rules

### Things to avoid
- **Emdashes (—).** Do not use them. Restructure the sentence instead, or use a comma, period, or parentheses.
- **Semicolons.** Keep sentence structure simple. If you need a semicolon, make it two sentences.
- **Passive voice.** "Wait times were observed to decrease" should be "Wait times drop."
- **Weasel words.** "Somewhat," "relatively," "fairly," "quite," "arguably." Cut them.

### Things to use
- **Bold** for key numbers, park names in context, and critical insights. Use it to help skimmers find the good stuff.
- **Exclamation marks** where genuine enthusiasm is warranted. Don't force them.
- **Short paragraphs.** 2-4 sentences each. A wall of text is a wall people leave.
- **Markdown tables** for the one data comparison per article.

## Content Rules

### Every article needs real numbers
Even if we're using representative ranges based on observed patterns, the article should include specific wait time figures. "Averaging 35 minutes" is better than "moderate waits." Ranges are fine ("55 to 70 minutes") but don't be vague.

### Every article needs actionable takeaways
The reader should finish the article knowing exactly what to do differently. "Save Harry Potter for the evening" is an actionable takeaway. "Wait times vary by world" is not.

### CTA placement
Every article ends with a mention of ParkPlannerAI's tools. Keep it to one sentence linking to /analytics and/or /plan. Do not put CTAs mid-article.

### Park and ride names
- Use official names: "Walt Disney World," not "Disney World" (though "Disney World" is acceptable in casual context after first reference).
- Use full ride names on first reference: "Harry Potter and the Battle at the Ministry." After that, "Battle at the Ministry" is fine.
- "Epic Universe," not "Universal's Epic Universe" or "Universal Epic Universe."

## Article Categories and Templates

### Wait Times by Land
Structure: Intro → why the gap exists → one H2 per land (keyword-rich) → summary table → closing CTA.

### Hour-by-Hour
Structure: Intro → the general daily curve → one H2 per time block (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) → summary table with hourly data → closing CTA.

### Day-of-Week
Structure: Intro → the best day → the worst day → why the pattern exists → what to do if you're stuck on a bad day → summary table → closing CTA.

### Cross-Park Comparison
Structure: Intro → one H2 per park being compared → the key differentiators → summary ranking table → closing CTA.

### Behavioral (myth-busting, patterns)
Structure: Intro with the common belief → what the data actually shows → park-by-park breakdown → practical strategy → closing CTA.

### Data Story (rankings, hidden gems)
Structure: Intro with the hook → walk through findings one by one under keyword-rich headings → summary table → closing CTA.
