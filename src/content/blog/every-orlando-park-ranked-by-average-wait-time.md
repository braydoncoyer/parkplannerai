The gap between Orlando's shortest-wait park and its longest-wait park is **over 25 minutes per ride**. Across a full day of 8 to 10 attractions, that difference adds up to more than three hours of standing in line. We ranked all seven major Orlando parks from shortest to longest average wait time so you can pick the right park for how you want to spend your day.

## How We Calculated Average Wait Times for Each Orlando Park

We tracked posted wait times across every major attraction at all seven parks over a rolling 90-day window. The averages reflect standard operating days (excluding holidays and special events) during normal park hours. We weighted headliner rides and family attractions equally because a 60-minute wait on a spinner hurts just as much as a 60-minute wait on a coaster.

One critical note before the rankings: a low park-wide average does not automatically mean a better experience. Parks with fewer rides concentrate demand on a smaller number of attractions, which can mean the rides you actually care about have longer individual waits even if the park average looks tame. Keep that tension in mind as you read through these rankings.

## #1 Animal Kingdom Has the Shortest Average Wait in Orlando

**Disney's Animal Kingdom** takes the top spot with a park-wide average of just **24 to 33 minutes**. That number is remarkably low for a Disney park, and it comes down to two things: early closing times that thin afternoon crowds, and a ride lineup where most attractions have strong throughput.

Kilimanjaro Safaris loads massive vehicles. Expedition Everest dispatches efficiently. DINOSAUR moves guests through at a steady clip. The only ride that breaks the pattern is **Flight of Passage at 50 to 65 minutes**, and even that drops significantly after 5 PM. If you strip out Flight of Passage, the rest of the park averages closer to **20 minutes**. Animal Kingdom gives you a full park day with minimal queue fatigue.

## #2 Islands of Adventure Delivers Thrills Without the Wait

**Universal's Islands of Adventure** ranks second with a park-wide average of **26 to 38 minutes**. This is the park that proves you don't have to sacrifice ride quality for shorter lines. VelociCoaster, one of the best coasters on Earth, has settled into a comfortable **30 to 45 minute** range. The Incredible Hulk Coaster regularly posts waits under **30 minutes**.

The Epic Universe effect plays a big role here. Since Universal's newest park opened, a significant chunk of the Potter-focused crowd has shifted away from Islands of Adventure. Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure still commands the longest wait in the park at **55 to 75 minutes**, but the rest of the lineup breathes easier than it has in years. You get world-class attractions at crowd levels that feel almost generous.

## #3 Universal Studios Florida Benefits from the Epic Universe Effect

**Universal Studios Florida** comes in at **27 to 39 minutes** on average, sitting just a hair behind Islands of Adventure. The two Universal legacy parks are so close in wait times that the difference is negligible on most days.

Universal Studios Florida benefits from the same crowd redistribution that helps Islands of Adventure. The park also runs high-capacity ride systems across its major attractions. Revenge of the Mummy, Transformers, and the Men in Black queue all move at a pace that keeps posted times honest. Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit sits around **35 to 50 minutes** as the park's longest consistent wait, but that is tame compared to what Disney's headliners pull.

## #4 EPCOT Sits in the Middle of the Pack

**EPCOT** lands at **31 to 44 minutes** on average, making it the middle child of the Orlando wait time rankings. The World Showcase acts as a natural crowd diffuser. Guests wander between countries eating and drinking, which pulls bodies out of ride queues in a way no other park layout replicates.

Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind is the main wait time driver here, posting **50 to 70 minutes** on busy days. Test Track and Frozen Ever After round out the headliner tier at **35 to 50 minutes** each. But EPCOT also has a deeper bench of moderate attractions (Soarin', Remy's Ratatouille Adventure, Journey of Water) that keeps the overall average from climbing too high. EPCOT rewards the patient explorer who treats the park as a full-day experience rather than a ride checklist.

## #5 Hollywood Studios Packs Big Waits Into a Small Park

**Disney's Hollywood Studios** jumps to **39 to 54 minutes** on average, and the reason is structural. Hollywood Studios has fewer total attractions than any other Disney park, which funnels guests into the same handful of queues. When everyone wants to ride the same 6 rides, posted times climb fast.

**Slinky Dog Dash** regularly hits **55 to 70 minutes**. Tower of Terror holds at **45 to 60 minutes**. Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance, despite its virtual queue history, still commands **50 to 65 minutes** during peak hours. The park's compact layout means there is no escape valve. Unlike EPCOT's World Showcase or Animal Kingdom's nature trails, Hollywood Studios has minimal non-ride diversions to pull crowds away from queues. You feel the density here more than anywhere else at Disney.

## #6 Epic Universe Posts High Averages Thanks to Record-Breaking Headliners

**Universal's Epic Universe** averages **40 to 55 minutes** across the full park, but that number hides an extreme split. The Wizarding World and Super Nintendo World are posting some of the highest sustained wait times in Orlando history. **Battle at the Ministry regularly exceeds 120 minutes**, and **Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge** holds above **60 minutes** for most of the day.

Then there is the other side of Epic Universe. Dark Universe and How to Train Your Dragon's Isle of Berk post average waits of **15 to 25 minutes** on their attractions. Celestial Park's rides hover around **10 to 20 minutes**. The park is essentially two different wait time experiences stitched together, and your overall impression depends entirely on how you build your day. Guests who prioritize the hyped worlds will feel like Epic Universe is the longest-wait park in Orlando. Guests who spread their time across all five worlds will have a balanced, manageable day.

## #7 Magic Kingdom Has the Longest Average Wait Times in Orlando

**Magic Kingdom** sits at the bottom of the rankings with a park-wide average of **46 to 60 minutes**. This surprises nobody who has visited recently, but the scale of the gap is worth emphasizing. Magic Kingdom's average wait is nearly **double** Animal Kingdom's average wait. That is not a rounding error.

The culprit is a combination of massive popularity and aging ride systems. **Seven Dwarfs Mine Train** pushes **70 to 90 minutes**. **Peter Pan's Flight** holds at **55 to 70 minutes** despite being a ride that lasts barely two minutes. **TRON Lightcycle Run** posts **50 to 65 minutes** on standard days. These rides have lower hourly throughput than modern attractions, so even moderate crowd levels create long lines. Magic Kingdom also draws the highest raw attendance of any park in the world, which means the demand side of the equation never lets up.

None of this means Magic Kingdom is a bad park. It means you need to plan your day more carefully here than anywhere else in Orlando.

## What Influences a Park's Average Wait Time Ranking

Four factors drive these rankings. **Total ride count** matters because parks with more attractions spread demand across more queues. Magic Kingdom has **30+ rides** but still posts the longest averages because the crowd volume overwhelms the supply. **Ride throughput** is the mechanical reality of how many guests a ride system can process per hour. Modern Universal coasters move significantly more riders than classic Disney dark rides. **Park capacity and attendance** set the demand ceiling. Magic Kingdom pulls more daily guests than any other Orlando park, and that raw volume creates pressure no ride design can fully absorb. **Layout and non-ride diversions** act as relief valves. EPCOT's World Showcase and Animal Kingdom's nature trails pull guests away from ride queues in ways that Hollywood Studios simply cannot.

## Every Orlando Park Ranked by Average Wait Time

| Rank | Park | Avg. Wait | Longest Individual Wait | Key Factor |
|------|------|-----------|------------------------|------------|
| 1 | Animal Kingdom | 24-33 min | 65 min (Flight of Passage) | Early close thins crowds |
| 2 | Islands of Adventure | 26-38 min | 75 min (Hagrid's) | Epic Universe crowd shift |
| 3 | Universal Studios Florida | 27-39 min | 50 min (Rip Ride Rockit) | High-capacity ride systems |
| 4 | EPCOT | 31-44 min | 70 min (Cosmic Rewind) | World Showcase disperses crowds |
| 5 | Hollywood Studios | 39-54 min | 70 min (Slinky Dog Dash) | Few rides, concentrated demand |
| 6 | Epic Universe | 40-55 min | 120+ min (Battle at the Ministry) | Hyped worlds inflate average |
| 7 | Magic Kingdom | 46-60 min | 90 min (Seven Dwarfs Mine Train) | Highest attendance, older ride systems |

## Which Orlando Park Is the Best Value If You Hate Waiting in Line

**Animal Kingdom** and **Islands of Adventure** are the clear winners for visitors who prioritize short waits. Both deliver a full day of quality attractions at averages under **35 minutes**, and both offer genuinely world-class rides (Flight of Passage and VelociCoaster, respectively) that justify the price of admission on their own.

For visitors who want a middle ground between short waits and a packed ride lineup, **Universal Studios Florida** and **EPCOT** hit the sweet spot. You get more total attractions to fill your day, and average waits stay in that **30 to 45 minute** range where you never feel stuck.

If Magic Kingdom is non-negotiable (and for many families, it is), commit to a rope drop strategy and front-load your headliners in the first 90 minutes. The difference between a planned Magic Kingdom day and an unplanned one can easily be **two hours of saved queue time**.
