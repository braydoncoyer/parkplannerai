Disney's Hollywood Studios packs four mega-headliners into one of the smallest parks at Walt Disney World, and that math creates a problem. Rise of the Resistance, Slinky Dog Dash, Tower of Terror, and Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway generate massive demand with limited capacity, which means picking the wrong hour can cost you **60 to 90 minutes** on a single ride.

We tracked hourly wait time data across every major Hollywood Studios attraction to find the exact windows when lines are shortest. Here's the full hour-by-hour breakdown so you can ride more and wait less.

## How Hollywood Studios Wait Times Change Throughout the Day

The daily curve at Hollywood Studios is steeper than any other Walt Disney World park. Waits spike faster after opening, hit a higher ceiling during midday, and stay elevated longer into the afternoon. The reason is simple: fewer rides absorbing the same massive crowds.

On a moderate day, Rise of the Resistance opens around **40 minutes** and climbs past **100 minutes** by late morning. On a peak Saturday, that same ride can sit above **120 minutes** for five straight hours. The shape of the curve stays consistent no matter the day. Fast morning rise, brutal midday plateau, gradual evening decline, and then a sharp drop during the nighttime spectacular.

Understanding that shape gives you an enormous advantage. Two guests can visit on the same day and ride wildly different numbers of attractions purely based on when they choose to queue up.

## What Happens to Wait Times Between 8 AM and 10 AM at Hollywood Studios

Early Entry (available to Disney resort guests) starts **30 minutes** before the park opens to everyone, and those 30 minutes are the single most valuable window of your entire day. During Early Entry, Rise of the Resistance averages **25 to 40 minutes**. That is the lowest you will ever see this ride without a Lightning Lane. Slinky Dog Dash sits at **15 to 25 minutes** during the same window.

When general admission opens at 9 AM, you still have a strong window, but it's closing fast. Headliner averages sit at **20 to 35 minutes** during the 9 AM hour for guests who move quickly. Tower of Terror and Runaway Railway can both be knocked out in under **25 minutes** if you hit them before 9:30.

By 10 AM, the advantage is gone. Average headliner waits jump to **45 to 65 minutes** as the full wave of day guests clears the entrance and spreads into Galaxy's Edge and Toy Story Land. The 8 to 10 AM block is where you win or lose your Hollywood Studios day.

Your Early Entry priority should be Rise of the Resistance. It builds the fastest and never truly has a short wait later in the day. After Rise, head straight to Toy Story Land for Slinky Dog Dash before standby guests pile in. If you can knock out both before 9:45, you've already beaten Hollywood Studios' two longest lines!

## Why 11 AM to 3 PM Is the Worst Time to Ride at Hollywood Studios

This is the dead zone, and at Hollywood Studios, it hurts more than any other park. Rise of the Resistance pushes **90 to 130 minutes** during peak midday hours. Slinky Dog Dash hovers at **60 to 85 minutes**. Tower of Terror climbs to **50 to 65 minutes**. Even Runaway Railway, which has solid ride capacity, sits at **40 to 55 minutes**.

The problem is density. Hollywood Studios is physically small, and it has fewer attractions to absorb the crowd. Every other Walt Disney World park has more rides to spread guests across. At Hollywood Studios, the limited ride count means every queue gets hammered simultaneously during midday.

This is the time to eat, explore, and ride the attractions that hold up under pressure. Star Tours almost never exceeds **20 minutes**, even during the worst of the midday crush. Muppet*Vision 3D is a walk-on most of the day. The Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular and other shows give you air conditioning and entertainment without a wait. Use midday for these experiences and save your headliner energy for later.

## How Wait Times Drop Between 4 PM and 7 PM at Hollywood Studios

The afternoon decline starts around **4 PM** and picks up speed through the dinner hour. By 4 PM, average headliner waits have dropped **10 to 20 minutes** from their midday peaks. By 6 PM, the drop accelerates noticeably as families leave and dinner pulls guests into restaurants.

Tower of Terror is the first headliner to benefit. It regularly dips to **35 to 45 minutes** by 5 PM while Rise of the Resistance is still holding above **80 minutes**. Rock 'n' Roller Coaster drops into the **30 to 40 minute** range during this window. These Sunset Boulevard rides are your best targets for late afternoon because they come down faster than Galaxy's Edge or Toy Story Land attractions.

Runaway Railway also becomes efficient in this block, dropping to **25 to 35 minutes** by 6 PM. It's a great option to slot between your Sunset Boulevard rides as you work your way through the park.

## Why the Nighttime Show Creates the Best Riding Window at Hollywood Studios

Here's the strategy that separates efficient guests from everyone else. When Fantasmic! or the nighttime projection show begins, wait times across Hollywood Studios crater. Thousands of guests pack into the Fantasmic! amphitheater or gather along Hollywood Boulevard, and the ride queues thin out dramatically.

During the nighttime show window (typically starting around **7:30 to 8:30 PM** depending on the season), headliner waits can drop by **30% to 50%** compared to just two hours earlier. Rise of the Resistance can fall to **55 to 70 minutes**. That's still a real wait, but it's roughly half of the midday peak. Slinky Dog Dash drops to **30 to 40 minutes**. Tower of Terror can hit **25 to 35 minutes**. Rock 'n' Roller Coaster dips to **20 to 30 minutes**.

The last **60 to 90 minutes** before park close are the absolute best time to ride at Hollywood Studios after the Early Entry window. If you skipped Rise of the Resistance in the morning, the final hour is your best shot at a manageable wait. Get in line before closing time, and Disney will let you ride even if the park officially closes while you're queuing.

Riding Tower of Terror at night is also the better experience. The park lit up below you as you drop is something you don't get during the day!

## The Best Hour-by-Hour Touring Plan for Hollywood Studios

The data points to a clear structure. Use Early Entry for Rise of the Resistance. Sprint to Slinky Dog Dash at general opening. Hit Tower of Terror and Runaway Railway before 10 AM. Take a long break or ride low-wait attractions from 11 AM to 4 PM. Re-enter the headliner queues in late afternoon, starting with Sunset Boulevard. Then use the nighttime show window to mop up anything you missed.

Here's how average wait times break down hour by hour across Hollywood Studios' top attractions:

| Time Block | Rise of the Resistance | Slinky Dog Dash | Tower of Terror | Runaway Railway |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 AM (Early Entry) | 25–40 min | 15–25 min | N/A | N/A |
| 9 AM | 40–55 min | 25–40 min | 15–25 min | 15–25 min |
| 10 AM | 65–85 min | 45–60 min | 30–40 min | 25–35 min |
| 11 AM | 85–110 min | 60–80 min | 45–55 min | 35–50 min |
| 12 PM | 95–130 min | 65–85 min | 50–65 min | 40–55 min |
| 1 PM | 95–130 min | 65–85 min | 50–65 min | 40–55 min |
| 2 PM | 90–120 min | 60–80 min | 50–60 min | 40–50 min |
| 3 PM | 85–110 min | 55–75 min | 45–55 min | 35–45 min |
| 4 PM | 80–100 min | 50–65 min | 40–50 min | 30–40 min |
| 5 PM | 75–90 min | 45–55 min | 35–45 min | 25–35 min |
| 6 PM | 70–85 min | 40–50 min | 30–40 min | 25–35 min |
| 7 PM | 65–80 min | 35–45 min | 30–40 min | 20–30 min |
| 8 PM+ | 55–70 min | 30–40 min | 25–35 min | 15–25 min |

The pattern is unmistakable. **Early Entry** and the **last 90 minutes before close** are your two golden windows. The midday plateau from 11 AM to 3 PM costs you the most time per ride by a huge margin.

Hollywood Studios rewards guests who front-load and back-load their day. Hit it hard before 10 AM, take a real break during the brutal midday hours, and then close out the night while everyone else is watching Fantasmic. Follow that structure and you can realistically hit every headliner with total wait time under **three hours**, a feat that takes most guests six or more hours to accomplish!
