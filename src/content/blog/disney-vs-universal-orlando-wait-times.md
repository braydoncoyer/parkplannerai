Orlando has seven major theme parks, and the difference in average wait times between the best and worst is staggering. **Animal Kingdom averages 25 to 35 minutes** per attraction while **Magic Kingdom pushes 45 to 60 minutes** on a typical day. Choosing the right park on the right day can save you hours of standing in line, and we've got the numbers to prove it.

We've been tracking wait time data across all four Walt Disney World parks and all three Universal Orlando parks to answer the question every Orlando visitor asks: Disney or Universal for shorter lines? The answer isn't as simple as picking one resort over the other.

## How Walt Disney World Wait Times Compare Across Four Parks

Disney's four parks cover an enormous range of wait time experiences. The problem is that most visitors default to Magic Kingdom, and Magic Kingdom is consistently the longest-wait park in all of Orlando.

**Magic Kingdom** averages **45 to 60 minutes** across its headliner attractions on a standard operating day. Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, Peter Pan's Flight, and TRON Lightcycle Run all regularly exceed 60 minutes, and the park's older ride systems have lower hourly throughput than modern attractions. That means even moderate crowds create long posted waits.

**Hollywood Studios** comes in second on the Disney side, with an average of **40 to 55 minutes** for its top rides. Slinky Dog Dash and Tower of Terror anchor the wait times here, but the park has fewer total attractions than Magic Kingdom, which concentrates demand on a smaller number of rides.

**EPCOT** is where things start looking better. Average waits sit around **30 to 45 minutes** for headliners, and the park's sprawling layout (especially the World Showcase) disperses crowds effectively. Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind pulls heavy demand, but rides like Test Track and Frozen Ever After have settled into more manageable patterns.

**Animal Kingdom** is Disney's clear winner for short lines. With averages of **25 to 35 minutes** across most attractions, it's the most relaxed park day Disney offers. Flight of Passage still commands respect at **50 to 65 minutes**, but everything else in the park stays surprisingly tame. The park's early closing time means afternoon crowds thin out fast.

## How Universal Orlando Wait Times Stack Up Across Three Parks

Universal's lineup looks different than it did a year ago. Epic Universe changed the equation completely, and the ripple effects have been felt across the entire resort.

**Epic Universe** is the wildcard. As Universal's newest park, it's pulling massive crowds and posting some of the longest individual ride waits in Orlando. Battle at the Ministry regularly hits **180+ minutes**, and Mario Kart stays above **60 minutes** for most of the day. But the park also has worlds like Dark Universe and Isle of Berk where you can walk onto attractions in under **20 minutes**. The park-wide average lands around **40 to 55 minutes**, though that number swings wildly depending on which world you're in.

**Islands of Adventure** has quietly become one of Orlando's best parks for manageable wait times. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter still draws heavy traffic, but the rest of the park averages **25 to 40 minutes**. Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure remains the outlier at **55 to 75 minutes**, but attractions like the VelociCoaster have settled into a comfortable **30 to 45 minute** range now that the initial hype has matured.

**Universal Studios Florida** sits in a similar range, averaging **25 to 40 minutes** across most attractions. Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit and Hagrid's demand have actually decreased since Epic Universe opened, pulling some of the Potter-focused crowd to the new park. This is a real benefit of Universal's expansion. The older parks are breathing easier.

## Why Universal's Older Parks Have Shorter Lines Than Disney's

Two factors explain the gap. First, Epic Universe is acting as a crowd sponge for the entire Universal resort. Guests who previously spent two days at Universal Studios Florida and Islands of Adventure are now dedicating at least one full day to Epic Universe. That's redistributing demand in a way that benefits the original parks.

Second, ride capacity. Universal has invested heavily in high-throughput ride systems over the past decade. Attractions like VelociCoaster, Hagrid's, and the newer additions move significantly more riders per hour than many of Disney's classic attractions. Peter Pan's Flight at Magic Kingdom has a fraction of the hourly capacity of a modern Universal coaster, and that difference shows up directly in posted wait times.

Disney's parks also face a density problem. Magic Kingdom packs **30+ attractions** into a relatively compact footprint, but most guests cluster around the same 8 to 10 headliners. Universal's parks have fewer total rides, but the demand is more evenly distributed across them.

## Epic Universe Makes the Comparison Unpredictable

Here's the honest truth about Epic Universe: the data is still volatile. We're seeing week-to-week swings of **15 to 20 minutes** in average wait times as Universal adjusts operations, adds capacity, and as the initial surge of grand-opening tourists begins to level off.

The Wizarding World and Super Nintendo World inside Epic Universe are posting some of the highest sustained wait times in Orlando right now. But the park's other three worlds are posting some of the lowest. That contrast makes Epic Universe hard to rank as a single entity. Your experience depends entirely on which worlds you prioritize and when you visit them.

By summer 2026, we expect the data to stabilize. Until then, treat Epic Universe as two parks in one: a high-wait park (Potter and Nintendo) and a low-wait park (Dark Universe, Isle of Berk, Celestial Park).

## Which Orlando Park Should You Visit If You Hate Long Lines

If your top priority is avoiding lines, the ranking is clear. **Animal Kingdom** and **Islands of Adventure** are your best options right now, both averaging under **35 minutes** for most attractions. They offer completely different experiences, but both deliver a full park day without the queue fatigue that Magic Kingdom or Epic Universe's headliner worlds will give you.

For a middle-ground option, **EPCOT** and **Universal Studios Florida** both hover in that **30 to 45 minute** sweet spot where you're getting onto rides at a reasonable pace without feeling like you're rushing.

Avoid **Magic Kingdom** on weekends and holidays if wait times are your main concern. It's the most-visited park on Earth for a reason, and the crowds reflect that reality every single day.

| Park                      | Avg. Wait   | Peak Wait  | Best For                       |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| Animal Kingdom            | 25–35 min   | 65 min     | Relaxed day, short lines       |
| Islands of Adventure      | 25–40 min   | 75 min     | Thrill rides without the wait  |
| Universal Studios Florida | 25–40 min   | 60 min     | Balanced experience            |
| EPCOT                     | 30–45 min   | 70 min     | Culture + rides combo          |
| Hollywood Studios         | 40–55 min   | 80 min     | Star Wars and Toy Story fans   |
| Epic Universe             | 40–55 min   | 180+ min   | New park energy (plan around headliners) |
| Magic Kingdom             | 45–60 min   | 85+ min    | Classic Disney (expect crowds) |

The bottom line: Universal's older parks currently edge out Disney for shorter overall wait times, largely thanks to Epic Universe absorbing a chunk of the resort's total demand. Disney's best option for short lines is Animal Kingdom, and it's not close. Magic Kingdom remains the longest-wait park in Orlando, but it's also the one park most people refuse to skip.
