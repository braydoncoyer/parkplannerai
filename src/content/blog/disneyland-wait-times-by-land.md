**Galaxy's Edge** and **Fantasyland** can eat two or three hours of your day in queues alone, while **Frontierland** and **Adventureland** sit a few hundred feet away with headliners averaging under 30 minutes. The wait time gaps between Disneyland's eight lands are staggering.

We've been tracking wait time data across every Disneyland land to map out where the crowds cluster and when they shift. Here's how all eight lands compare and the touring strategy that the numbers say works best.

## Why Wait Times Vary So Much Between Disneyland's Eight Lands

Three forces create Disneyland's lopsided crowd distribution. First, ride capacity. Galaxy's Edge and Fantasyland move fewer guests per hour than older high-capacity designs like Pirates of the Caribbean. When demand outpaces throughput, waits balloon fast.

Second, emotional draw. Star Wars and classic Disney princesses generate a "must-do" urgency that other lands don't. Guests tolerate a 90-minute wait for Rise of the Resistance in a way they never would for Big Thunder Mountain.

Third, park geography. Galaxy's Edge sits in the back-left corner, which should reduce early crowds, but the Star Wars magnetism overrides the distance every morning.

## Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge Has the Longest Waits at Disneyland

The data here is definitive. Rise of the Resistance averages **70 to 95 minutes** on a standard operating day and pushes past **120 minutes** on Saturdays and holiday periods. It is the longest wait at Disneyland, and that one ride reshapes how the entire park flows.

Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run averages **30 to 45 minutes** thanks to a higher-capacity system that loads six guests per cockpit. It's one of the most efficient headliners in the park.

Your best window for Rise of the Resistance is the **last 90 minutes before park close**, when waits drop to **40 to 55 minutes**. If you have Early Entry, make Rise your first move. You can catch it under **30 minutes** before the general public floods in!

## Fantasyland Wait Times: Why the Lines Never Seem to Shrink

Fantasyland is Disneyland's other crowd magnet. Matterhorn Bobsleds averages **40 to 60 minutes** throughout the day. Alice in Wonderland and Mr. Toad's Wild Ride hover around **30 to 45 minutes** during peak hours. Even Peter Pan's Flight pulls **35 to 50 minutes** with alarming consistency.

Most Fantasyland dark rides use small vehicles on slow-moving track systems. The demand has grown enormously over the decades, but ride capacity hasn't kept pace.

The **first 45 minutes after rope drop** can get you through two or three rides before lines stack up. Waits climb steadily after that and don't recover until dinner time. The window between **7 PM and close** is your second chance to knock out the classics.

## Tomorrowland Wait Times: Space Mountain Sets the Pace

Tomorrowland lives in the middle tier. Space Mountain is the anchor, averaging **40 to 55 minutes** during normal operations. It spikes on busy weekends but rarely crosses the **70-minute** mark.

Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters averages just **15 to 25 minutes** for most of the day. Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage is a wildcard, pushing **30 to 45 minutes** during peak hours but dropping to **15 minutes** or less in the evenings.

Tomorrowland is a strong rope drop target if Galaxy's Edge isn't your priority. Space Mountain sits a five-minute walk from the entrance, and you can ride it in under **15 minutes** at opening. From there, swing into Fantasyland while waits are still building.

## Adventureland Is Disneyland's Most Efficient Land for Wait Times

Adventureland punches above its weight. Indiana Jones Adventure is one of the best rides in the park, averaging just **30 to 45 minutes** on a typical day. That's a fraction of what Rise of the Resistance demands. Jungle Cruise averages **20 to 35 minutes** and dips below **15 minutes** during evening hours.

Indiana Jones loads large vehicles on a continuous system that moves guests through at a strong hourly rate. Hit it in the first two hours after opening or after 6 PM. But even midday waits are manageable here. This is the land where you don't need to stress about timing!

## New Orleans Square and Critter Country: Disneyland's Low-Wait Corner

These two lands form Disneyland's most relaxed zone. Haunted Mansion averages **20 to 30 minutes** thanks to its massive Doom Buggy system. Pirates of the Caribbean rarely exceeds **20 minutes**, even when the line looks long.

Over in Critter Country, Tiana's Bayou Adventure is the exception, pulling **45 to 65 minutes** as guests flock to the reimagined attraction. Winnie the Pooh averages **15 to 25 minutes**. Hit Haunted Mansion and Pirates whenever you pass through. No special timing required.

## Frontierland Wait Times Stay Manageable All Day

Frontierland is Disneyland's most predictable land. Big Thunder Mountain Railroad averages **30 to 40 minutes** throughout the day and rarely spikes above **55 minutes** even on peak weekends. The Mark Twain Riverboat and Sailing Ship Columbia are walk-on experiences that give you a chance to rest your legs.

Big Thunder benefits from an evening ride. Waits drop to **20 to 30 minutes** after dinner, and riding the coaster at night with the rockwork lit up is a noticeably better experience!

## Mickey's Toontown Wait Times After the 2023 Reimagining

Mickey's Toontown draws families with young children. Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway is the headliner, averaging **35 to 50 minutes** on a typical day. Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin averages **20 to 30 minutes**, and Chip 'n' Dale's GADGETcoaster pulls **15 to 25 minutes**.

Toontown peaks between **10 AM and 2 PM** when families with young kids are at their most active. By late afternoon, many of those families have left the park, and Toontown quiets down significantly.

## Disneyland Wait Times by Land: The Full Comparison

Here's how average wait times stack up across all eight Disneyland lands:

| Land | Avg. Wait | Peak Wait | Best Window |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Galaxy's Edge | 50–70 min | 120+ min | Early Entry or last 90 min |
| Fantasyland | 35–50 min | 65+ min | First 45 min or after 7 PM |
| Toontown | 25–40 min | 55 min | Late afternoon |
| Tomorrowland | 25–40 min | 60 min | Rope drop |
| Adventureland | 25–35 min | 50 min | Anytime (best before 10 AM) |
| Critter Country | 25–35 min | 65 min | Evening |
| Frontierland | 25–35 min | 55 min | Evening after dinner |
| New Orleans Square | 15–25 min | 35 min | Anytime |

Galaxy's Edge and Fantasyland dominate the wait time charts, while the western side of the park (New Orleans Square, Frontierland, Critter Country) consistently offers shorter lines with excellent attractions.

Start your morning with Rise of the Resistance at Early Entry, swing through Fantasyland in the first 45 minutes of general opening, fill your midday with Adventureland and New Orleans Square, and close out your evening with Big Thunder and Tiana's Bayou Adventure. That flow keeps you ahead of the crowd wave all day!
