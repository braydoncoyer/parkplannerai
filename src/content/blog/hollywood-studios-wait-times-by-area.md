Disney's Hollywood Studios has three areas that eat up the vast majority of your day, and the wait time gaps between them are dramatic. One land regularly posts waits above two hours while another has a headliner you can ride in under 30 minutes if you time it right.

We've been tracking wait time data across every area at Hollywood Studios so you can stop guessing and start planning. Here's how Galaxy's Edge, Toy Story Land, and Sunset Boulevard actually compare, plus the touring order that the numbers say works best.

## Why Hollywood Studios Wait Times Vary So Much by Area

Hollywood Studios is a compact park, but it doesn't feel that way when you look at the data. The spread between the busiest and calmest areas is enormous, and three factors drive the gap.

First, Rise of the Resistance. This single ride warps the entire park's crowd patterns. It pulls guests into Galaxy's Edge like a black hole, and its lower-than-expected hourly throughput keeps waits sky-high all day. When one attraction accounts for the longest line in all of Walt Disney World, it reshapes how every other area in the park operates.

Second, family demand. Toy Story Land attracts a different crowd than Galaxy's Edge, but the volume is just as intense. Families with young kids flock to Slinky Dog Dash because it's one of the few coasters at Disney World that works for everyone. That universal appeal creates lines that rival rides three times its intensity level.

Third, park layout. Hollywood Studios funnels guests past Sunset Boulevard early, then deeper into Galaxy's Edge and Toy Story Land. Guests who beeline for Star Wars at rope drop create a traffic jam that doesn't clear until evening.

## Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge Has the Longest Wait Times at Hollywood Studios

This is where the numbers get wild. Rise of the Resistance averages **75 to 100 minutes** on a typical day and regularly pushes past **120 minutes** during peak periods. On busy Saturdays and holiday weeks, **150+ minute** waits are not unusual. It is consistently the longest wait in the entire park, and it's not close.

Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run tells a different story. It averages **35 to 50 minutes** because its ride system has a much higher hourly capacity. Disney loads six guests per cockpit and runs the system efficiently. Smugglers Run is actually one of the better values in Galaxy's Edge from a wait-to-experience standpoint.

Your best window for Rise of the Resistance is the last hour before park close. Waits can drop to **50 to 60 minutes**, roughly half of the midday peak. If you have Early Entry, Rise of the Resistance should be your first move of the day. You can catch it under **40 minutes** in those early morning minutes before the floodgates open!

## Why Slinky Dog Dash Has a Longer Wait Than You'd Expect

Here's the most interesting pattern in the data. Slinky Dog Dash averages **55 to 75 minutes**, making it the second-longest wait in Hollywood Studios. That's wild for a family coaster that tops out at 40 mph with no inversions and no big drops.

The reason is simple: demand outpaces capacity. Slinky Dog Dash is the ride every family wants to do. Kids love it. Parents love it. Grandparents can ride it. That makes it the single most universally appealing attraction at Hollywood Studios, and the ride vehicle only holds a limited number of guests per cycle.

Alien Swirling Saucers, the other Toy Story Land attraction, averages just **20 to 30 minutes**. It's a spinning flat ride with modest demand, making it a quick grab whenever you're in the area. Don't plan your day around it. Just hop in line when you walk past.

The best time for Slinky Dog Dash is rope drop. If you skip Rise of the Resistance at Early Entry and head straight to Toy Story Land when the park opens to all guests, you can catch Slinky Dog under **30 minutes**. By 10 AM, that window is gone.

## Sunset Boulevard Wait Times: Tower of Terror and Rock 'n' Roller Coaster

Sunset Boulevard is the area most guests overlook when planning, and that's a mistake. It has two of the best rides at Hollywood Studios and some of the most predictable wait patterns in the park.

The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror averages **40 to 55 minutes** throughout the day. Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith runs slightly lower at **35 to 50 minutes**. Both rides benefit from solid hourly throughput, which keeps waits more manageable than you'd expect for attractions of this caliber.

What makes Sunset Boulevard interesting is the consistency. While Galaxy's Edge and Toy Story Land see dramatic spikes during midday, Sunset Boulevard stays in a relatively narrow range. You won't find many **20 minute** windows, but you also won't hit the **90+ minute** walls you see in other areas.

Evening is still your best bet here. Tower of Terror drops to **30 to 40 minutes** after dinner, and Rock 'n' Roller Coaster can dip below **30 minutes** in the final hours. Riding Tower of Terror at night is also the better experience!

## Other Hollywood Studios Areas Stay Short All Day

The remaining areas of Hollywood Studios are where you catch your breath. Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway in the Chinese Theatre area averages **30 to 45 minutes** and rarely spikes above **55 minutes**. It has great capacity and consistent demand throughout the day.

Star Tours in the Echo Lake area almost never exceeds **20 minutes**. It's a walk-on for most of the day, every day. Same goes for Muppet*Vision 3D, which hovers around **10 to 15 minutes** when it's not a walk-on entirely. These are perfect midday options when the big three areas are peaking.

## The Best Order to Tour Hollywood Studios Based on Wait Time Data

The numbers point to a clear strategy. Don't try to conquer Galaxy's Edge in the morning when every other guest has the same idea. Instead, use Early Entry for Rise of the Resistance (your one exception to the "skip the headliners early" rule, because this ride never has a truly short wait). Then head to Toy Story Land for Slinky Dog Dash before standby guests flood in.

Spend your midday in Sunset Boulevard, Echo Lake, and the Chinese Theatre area. These zones stay manageable from 11 AM to 4 PM while Galaxy's Edge and Toy Story Land are at their worst. Circle back to Smugglers Run and Tower of Terror in the evening when waits drop across the board.

Here's how average wait times compare across Hollywood Studios:

| Area | Avg. Wait | Peak Wait | Best Window |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Galaxy's Edge (Rise) | 75-100 min | 150+ min | Early Entry or last hour |
| Toy Story Land (Slinky Dog) | 55-75 min | 90+ min | Rope drop (first 30 min) |
| Sunset Boulevard | 35-50 min | 60 min | Evening after dinner |
| Galaxy's Edge (Smugglers Run) | 35-50 min | 70 min | Evening |
| Chinese Theatre (Runaway Railway) | 30-45 min | 55 min | Anytime |
| Echo Lake (Star Tours) | 10-20 min | 25 min | Anytime |

Start with Rise of the Resistance at Early Entry, grab Slinky Dog Dash at rope drop, fill your midday with Sunset Boulevard and the smaller areas, and end your night in Galaxy's Edge when the crowds thin out. That sequence can save you two or more hours of standing in line!
